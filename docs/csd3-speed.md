# Search speed on CSD3

Speed work for the 9-parameter space on CSD3. Newest round last.
[The speed index](nested-sampling-speed.md) covers the 5-parameter work on
the Hetzner host.

## Where the time went

`./ri profile` on the two most recent finished 9-parameter runs:

| run | simulate (MeqTrees) | imager | idle |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `wsclean-vlaa-20260922T144310Z` (4 ranks, 50 evals) | 1.40s, 44.6% | 0.95s, 30.2% | 22.5% |
| `r2d2-vlaa-20260922T174616Z` (24 ranks, 71,395 evals) | 1.94s, 34.7% | 2.87s, 51.4% | 11.5% |

On the Hetzner host simulate was ~13ms. The cause is the parameter space, not
CSD3. `source_l_pixels`/`source_m_pixels` move the source off the phase centre,
so every evaluation now runs a real MeqTrees predict. Before, the phase-centre
case wrote a constant. `integration_seconds` and `declination_deg` also make
nearly every evaluation a new MS shape, so the skeleton cache misses and
`makems` runs every time.

## Round 1: analytic predict

Probe: `scripts/probe_simulate_stage.py`, `simulate()` with each step timed, serial, one warm worker, on an icelake
node (Xeon 8368Q). Input is 48 parameter sets taken evenly from the 71k-eval
R2D2 run (mean 53.5k rows).

| step | before mean / median | after mean / median |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `makems` (cache miss, every eval) | 0.662s / 0.456s | 0.667s / 0.444s |
| MeqTrees predict | 0.794s / 0.632s | - |
| rest of the fill (noise, write) | 0.046s / 0.034s | 0.055s / 0.036s |
| **simulate total** | **1.515s / 1.133s** | **0.734s / 0.492s** |
| worker warm-up before the first request | 2.6-3.3s | 0.07s |

Both `makems` and the predict are linear in rows, at ~11us per row each. The
predict also has a ~0.25s floor.

The change: `point_source_visibilities()` writes
`I exp(+2 pi i f/c (u l + v m + w (n-1)))` on XX and YY with numpy, and the
worker no longer starts a meqserver. MeqTrees Meow reads UVW from the MS and
applies no smearing, so this is the whole of its predict.
`self_check_analytic_predict()` runs the real MeqTrees predict over 7 cases
(on and off centre, declinations -15 to 75, 1-120s integrations, up to 632k
rows). Worst difference: **4.7e-10 of the flux**, i.e. float32 rounding. The
phase-centre cases are bit-identical.

Other effects: MeqTrees deadlocks (one every 2,000-5,000 predicts,
[robustness](robustness.md)) and the `VisDataMux not found` failures that
survived their retry in the big run can no longer happen at run time. The
meqserver code is still there, used only by the self-check.

Expected run-level effect (measured in round 3): ~0.8-1.0s fewer
worker-seconds per evaluation, i.e. ~+25% evals/s for R2D2 on CPU and ~+45%
for WSClean.

Next: `makems` is now ~90% of simulate.

## Round 2: makems only for unseen observations

makems costs ~0.07s plus ~3.3ms a timestep: it converts all 27 antenna
positions to J2000 UVW every timestep. Timestep k of an observation does not
depend on its length, so the rows of a short observation are, bit for bit, the
first rows of a long one at the same declination and integration.

`make_ms()` caches, per (declination, integration), makems' per-antenna UVW
(relative to antenna 0) and the per-timestep times in an `.npz` beside the
skeleton cache. A later evaluation no longer than the cached one copies a
one-timestep template for its channel count, `addrows`, and writes UVW, TIME,
ANTENNA1/2, INTERVAL, EXPOSURE, the FIELD directions and OBSERVATION.TIME_RANGE.
A miss runs makems as before, then caches what it built (13ms), replacing a
shorter entry. `save_observation()` refuses to cache anything it cannot rebuild
bit for bit. `self_check_observation_prefix()` compares every column of MAIN
and the kept subtables, and the storage layout, with a fresh makems build after
the fill, over 8 hit/miss/grow steps.

Same probe and 48 parameter sets, icelake 8368Q. "Warm" first caches each set's
(declination, integration) at 20 minutes, the steady state of a long run:

| | cold cache | warm cache |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `makems` | 0.607s | 0.013s (templates: one per channel count) |
| extend template | - | 0.023s |
| fill | 0.047s | 0.048s |
| **simulate total** | **0.679s / 0.475s median** | **0.088s / 0.056s median** |

The hit rate grows with run length. Replaying uniform prior draws (the worst
case: a converging run revisits a narrower region) through the cache, the
share of timesteps still built by makems is 94% at 500 evaluations, 75% at
2,000, 37% at 10,000 and 9.5% at 71,395, the size of the last big R2D2 run.
There are 910 (declination, integration) keys; at full coverage the cache is
~200MB of `/dev/shm`.

## Round 3: end to end

`./ri bench run <imager> --repeat 2` on rounds 1+2 (`c7133fb`) and on the
commit before them (`076e395`, a second worktree), both started in one icelake
job so the arms race on the same node. Same seed, so both arms draw the same
evaluations; log(Z) was identical.

| | before | after | change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| WSClean, 16 ranks, 726 evals | 3.64 evals/s | 6.66 evals/s | **+83%** |
| - simulate per eval | 1.30s | 0.48s | |
| - WSClean per eval | 0.36s | 0.35s | |
| R2D2, 8 ranks, 50 evals | 2.18 evals/s | 2.66 evals/s | **+22%** |
| - simulate per eval | 1.01s | 0.48s | |
| - R2D2 per eval | 1.22s | 1.34s | |

Caveats. The WSClean baseline's second repeat ran alone after the other arm
finished, which flatters the baseline. Each R2D2 arm sized its threads for all
36 CPUs of the job (5 threads x 8 ranks, twice), so R2D2 was oversubscribed
in both arms, and more so in the faster one. These runs are short, so the
round-2 observation cache is cold: simulate is 0.48s here against ~0.09s warm.
Long runs will gain more.

How to repeat it: a job script `cd`s into each worktree and runs
`./ri bench run` in the background in both, with `NS_SBATCH=0`,
`RI_WORK_DIR=/rds/user/$USER/hpc-work` (job-env takes uv from the checkout's
parent dir, one level too deep for a nested worktree), and `SIF_DIR` and
`CHECKPOINTS_DIR` pointing at the main checkout.

`bench.py` fix: every CSD3 node shares one `/etc/machine-id`, so icelake and
ampere rows were grouped as one machine. Inside a Slurm job, the id now also
hashes the CPU model. Older CSD3 rows keep the shared id `39edb438`.

Next: WSClean is now 42% of a short WSClean run and R2D2 is 70% of an R2D2
run. In a long run the R2D2 share will be higher still.
