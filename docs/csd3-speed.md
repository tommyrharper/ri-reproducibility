# Search speed on CSD3

Speed work for the 9-parameter space on CSD3. Newest round last.
[The speed index](nested-sampling-speed.md) covers the 5-parameter work on
the Hetzner host.

## Where the time went

`./ri profile` on the two most recent finished 9-parameter runs:

| run | simulate (MeqTrees) | imager | idle |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `wsclean-vlaa-20260922T144310Z` (4 ranks, 50 evals) | 1.40s, 44.6% | 0.95s, 30.2% | 22.5% |
| `r2d2-vlaa-20260922T174616Z` (24 ranks, 71,395 evals) | 1.94s, 34.7% | 2.87s, 51.4% | 11.5% |

On the Hetzner host simulate was ~13ms. The cause is the parameter space, not
CSD3. `source_l_pixels`/`source_m_pixels` move the source off the phase centre,
so every evaluation now runs a real MeqTrees predict. Before, the phase-centre
case wrote a constant. `integration_seconds` and `declination_deg` also make
nearly every evaluation a new MS shape, so the skeleton cache misses and
`makems` runs every time.

## Round 1: analytic predict

Probe: `scripts/probe_simulate_stage.py`, `simulate()` with each step timed, serial, one warm worker, on an icelake
node (Xeon 8368Q). Input is 48 parameter sets taken evenly from the 71k-eval
R2D2 run (mean 53.5k rows).

| step | before mean / median | after mean / median |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `makems` (cache miss, every eval) | 0.662s / 0.456s | 0.667s / 0.444s |
| MeqTrees predict | 0.794s / 0.632s | - |
| rest of the fill (noise, write) | 0.046s / 0.034s | 0.055s / 0.036s |
| **simulate total** | **1.515s / 1.133s** | **0.734s / 0.492s** |
| worker warm-up before the first request | 2.6-3.3s | 0.07s |

Both `makems` and the predict are linear in rows, at ~11us per row each. The
predict also has a ~0.25s floor.

The change: `point_source_visibilities()` writes
`I exp(+2 pi i f/c (u l + v m + w (n-1)))` on XX and YY with numpy, and the
worker no longer starts a meqserver. MeqTrees Meow reads UVW from the MS and
applies no smearing, so this is the whole of its predict.
`self_check_analytic_predict()` runs the real MeqTrees predict over 7 cases
(on and off centre, declinations -15 to 75, 1-120s integrations, up to 632k
rows). Worst difference: **4.7e-10 of the flux**, i.e. float32 rounding. The
phase-centre cases are bit-identical.

Other effects: MeqTrees deadlocks (one every 2,000-5,000 predicts,
[robustness](robustness.md)) and the `VisDataMux not found` failures that
survived their retry in the big run can no longer happen at run time. The
meqserver code is still there, used only by the self-check.

Expected run-level effect, not yet measured end to end: ~0.8-1.0s fewer
worker-seconds per evaluation, i.e. ~+25% evals/s for R2D2 on CPU and ~+45%
for WSClean.

Next: `makems` is now ~90% of simulate.
